# Hurricane-Idalia-DES-Data
The purpose of this script is to generate a Hurricane Idalia Descrete Event Simulation (DES) Model for Kingston Beach, Flordia 
That would assist stakeholders with estimating the efficacy of speed and capacity of mobile logistic nodes concerning preparation for future disaster occurrences such as hurricanes, specifically Hurricane Idalia as quantitative, exploratory case study.  

Part one of the script is to conduct Data Integration & Transformation, Data Cleaning, &
# Data Preparation before developing Hurricane Idalia's Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Model 

Part two of the script is to perform Data Feature Engineering and Data Exploration before 
# Performing Feature Engineering and Data Exploration before developing the DES Model for Hurricane Idalia

Part three of the script is Hurricane Idalia DES Model that animates and plot the simulation results
In part three of the script a Hurricane Idalia Shelters and Affected Areas Map is generated, in addtion to Model Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning.
Model Validation is based on the research questions and provides a statement that says if the null hypothesis per research question was rejected or failed to reject the null hypothesis (therefore accepting the alternative hypothesis)
Two paired T-Test, Chi-Squared Test, Q-Q plot, Z-Score, and K-fold Cross Validation are test conducted within the script to test the model based on the research questions.
These questions are tested based on these variables: speed, capabilities, capacity,and throughput (mobile logistics), in some cases evacuation people are also tested in addtion to planned network paths (network paths).
